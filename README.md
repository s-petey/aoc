# Usage Instructions

Install dependencies (recommend `bun`)

To use the `gen` script:
`bun run gen` -- You will be prompted to enter the day you are working on and then the folder (or year).

EX: `bun run gen` -> `Enter day: 1` -> `Enter folder: 2024`

## Testing
It is recommended that you use `bun run test` or `bun run tdd` to execute the files you'd like to run. You can also filter the files you'd like to run by passing in the folder and file name as an argument. EX: `bun run tdd 2024/day3`.
